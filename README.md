Collections of short and simple utilities.
Mainly as a personal reminder

## fix-metadata
Fixes QuickTime timestamp to let different video editors/tools interoperate

## SSH-VPN
Quick and dirty VPN, using an SSH Tunnel to route your traffic through a SOCKS/HTTP proxy
After launching it, configure your browser/system to use the localhost:2222 SOCKS5 proxy.

This works also with smartphone, like iPhone: run the script on your computer, open network settings in your smartphone and set the computer IP/port a proxy, no authentication required
